This project is an online, printable balance sheet built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to easily input and edit financial data for Assets, Liabilities, and Equity, with automatic real-time calculations ensuring that the sheet always remains balanced. The design is fully responsive for desktop and tablet use, and includes a print-friendly layout optimized for clean PDF or paper output using CSS print media queries.

The application runs entirely in the browser with no backend, meaning your data stays local and private. It is simple to customizeâ€”sections, labels, currencies, and styles can be easily modified in the code. A built-in print option removes extra UI elements for a professional, easy-to-read final document.

This tool is ideal for individuals, small businesses, or students who need a quick, lightweight balance sheet generator without relying on complex software or cloud services.
